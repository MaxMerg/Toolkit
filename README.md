This is a toolkit ive been working on for online school. It will eventually have a bunch of formulas for math and some basic physics formulas. Just click the button associated with the formula and it will solve it for you after you give your numbers. You can also see a picture of the formula. The button and the picture of similar formulas will have the same number next to them.
